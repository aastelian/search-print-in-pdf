# search-print-in-pdf
This is an App that searches a string in a pdf file and let's you print that specific page that contains the searched word.

This is helping me at my current work in that it prints recall notifications for certain clients. I search a client's name in my source pdf which contains the recall notifications for all clients and then print the page of said client in a new pdf file (and then on paper).

The source pdf has a variable name, so first I need to rename it to <0.pdf> using .bat file. Then I type in a part of the client's name, the program sends me back a list with all the clients having that searched word in their names and after I click my desired client, the app prints its recall notifican in a new pdf. Then I click the <delete files> button to activate another .bat file to delete all pdfs used.
